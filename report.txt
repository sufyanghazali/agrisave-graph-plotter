learning how to use d3.js for visualizing data
learning how to use SVGs in html
parsed data from api call to be able to input into graph
sortDirection doesn't actually sort the data, from what I can see
manually sort the data using unixTimeStamp. The data set I was working with had very scattered data though so can't infer much from the graph

TODO
make graph interactive
